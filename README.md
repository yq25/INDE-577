by Yunneng Qian

netID: yq25


## Course Description

This data science course covers algorithms from supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. We implement many of the machine learning algorithms from scratch, but also make use of the Skikit-Learn and Tensorflow libraries. 

## Topics

### Supervised Learning

Model Building and Error Analysis

Linear Regression

Gradient Descent 

Logistic Regression

Neural Nets

Support Vector Machines

K-nearest Neighbors

Decision/Regression Trees

Ensemble Learning

### Unsupervised Learning

K-means clustering

Principle Component Analysis
