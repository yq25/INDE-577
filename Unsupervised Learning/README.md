# Unsupervised Learning

## What is unsupervised learning?

Unsupervised learning is a type of algorithm that learns patterns from untagged data. The hope is that through mimicry, which is an important mode of learning in people, the machine is forced to build a compact internal representation of its world and then generate imaginative content from it. In contrast to supervised learning where data is tagged by an expert, e.g. as a "ball" or "fish", unsupervised methods exhibit self-organization that captures patterns as probability densities or a combination of neural feature preferences. The other levels in the supervision spectrum are reinforcement learning where the machine is given only a numerical performance score as guidance, and semi-supervised learning where a smaller portion of the data is tagged. Two broad methods in Unsupervised Learning are Neural Networks and Probabilistic Methods.

## How unsupervised learning works?

In unsupervised learning, an AI system is presented with unlabeled, uncategorized data and the systemâ€™s algorithms act on the data without prior training. The output is dependent upon the coded algorithms. Subjecting a system to unsupervised learning is an established way of testing the capabilities of that system.

Unsupervised learning algorithms can perform more complex processing tasks than supervised learning systems. However, unsupervised learning can be more unpredictable than the alternate model. A system trained using the unsupervised model, might,  for example, figure out on its own how to differentiate cats and dogs, it might also add unexpected and undesired categories to deal with unusual breeds, which might end up cluttering things instead of keeping them in order.

For unsupervised learning algorithms, the AI system is presented with an unlabeled and uncategorized data set. The thing to keep in mind is that this system has not undergone any prior training. In essence, unsupervised learning can be thought of as learning without a teacher.

In case of supervised learning, the system has both the inputs and the outputs. So depending on the difference between the desired output and the observed output, the system is set to learn and improve. However, in the case of unsupervised learning, the system only has inputs and no outputs.
