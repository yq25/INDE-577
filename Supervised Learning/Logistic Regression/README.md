# Logistic Regression 

## What is logistic regression?

In statistics, the (binary) logistic model (or logit model) is a statistical model that models the probability of one event (out of two alternatives) taking place by having the log-odds (the logarithm of the odds) for the event be a linear combination of one or more independent variables ("predictors"). In regression analysis, logistic regression (or logit regression) is estimating the parameters of a logistic model (the coefficients in the linear combination). Formally, in binary logistic regression there is a single binary dependent variable, coded by a indicator variable, where the two values are labeled "0" and "1", while the independent variables can each be a binary variable (two classes, coded by an indicator variable) or a continuous variable (any real value). The corresponding probability of the value labeled "1" can vary between 0 (certainly the value "0") and 1 (certainly the value "1"), hence the labeling; the function that converts log-odds to probability is the logistic function, hence the name. 

## How logistic regression works?

Logistic regression works by measuring the relationship between the dependent variable (what we want to predict) and one or more independent variables (the features). It does this by estimating the probabilities with the help of its underlying logistic function.

## Datasets

### Palmer Penguins

The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis[source:WIkipedia]

Palmer Archipelago (Antarctica) penguin dataset appears to be a drop in replacemnt for the same. It is a great intro dataset for data exploration & visualization. Let's import the dataset and explore it to understand it better.
